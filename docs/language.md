# Nitrogen Language

This is not a formal specification of the Nitrogen language. This is simply a guide to the syntax and function of the language.

## Source Files

Nitrogen source files are read as valid UTF-8 characters.

## Keywords

|          |          |
|----------|----------|
| and      | as       |
| break    | catch    |
| class    | const    |
| continue | else     |
| false    | for      |
| func     | if       |
| import   | let      |
| make     | nil      |
| or       | pass     |
| return   | throw    |
| true     | try      |

## Semicolons

Nitrogen's formal grammar uses semicolons to denote the end of a statement or expression. However, Nitrogen code doesn't need to have
explicit semicolons as the lexer will automatically insert a semicolon where it's needed. Namely, after an identifier, literal,
nil, a closing parenthesis, curly or square bracket, and after the keywords `return`, `break`, and `continue`. This requires the
programmer to keep in mind how they're formatting code. For example, the following if statement is invalid:

```
if (var == 3) // The lexer attempts to insert a semicolon here, which will fail.
{
    print("It's a 3")
}
else
{
    print("No, it's not 3")
}
```

But the following is syntactically valid (though not recommended):

```
if (var == 3) { print("It's a 3") } else { print("No, it's not 3") }
```

The parser will catch any such errors and will warn the programmer.

## Comments

Nitrogen supports three styles of comments:

```
// This comment lasts to the end of the line
# As does this one, this is mainly for scripts and #! headers
/*
 * Multiline comments are also supported.
 */
```

## Pass

Empty blocks are invalid in Nitrogen and will fail compilation. If you want to use empty block, `pass` can be used. `pass` is
effectivly a noop but ensures a block has at least one statement.

## Literals

Nitrogen supports integers, floats, booleans, strings, null, arrays, and hash maps (dictionaries, associative arrays).

### Null

Nitrogen has a null value: `nil`. Nil can be returned from functions, returned from a bad array or map indexing, or
from other things.

### Numbers

Note: Currently, ints and floats CAN NOT be compared to each other. To compare, use the `toInt()` or `toFloat()` functions to convert
values between types.

#### Integers

Integers are implemented using Go's int64 type which means all ints are signed and 64 bits long. Integers can be declared using
decimal, octal, or hexadecimal notation. Here's a few examples:

```
45    // Decimal
0664  // Octal, leading 0
\xA4  // Hexadecimal, prefixed with \x
```

Ints support the standard arithmatic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
And of course ints can be compared to each other using <, >, ==, and !=.

#### Floats

Floating point numbers are implemented using Go's float64 type which means they are the same as a double in C or Java. Floats can only be represented
in dotted decimal notation. Exponential notation is coming soon. Like ints, floats support the standard arithmatic operations: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and modulo. Floats may be compared to each other.

### Operator Precedence

There are 5 main precedence levels for binary operators. The operators bind strongest from highest
level to lowest level. Operators on the same level are left associative and will bind left to right.

| Level | Operators          |
|:-----:|--------------------|
|   5   | `* / % >> << & &^` |
|   4   | `+ - \| ^`         |
|   3   | `< >`              |
|   2   | `== != <= >=`      |
|   1   | `and or`          |

### Arithmetic Operators

Here's a table that show all the binary operators and what number types that can be used on

| Op | Name                  | Types                        |
|----|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| +  |  sum                  |  integers, floats, strings   |
| -  |  difference           |  integers, floats            |
| *  |  product              |  integers, floats            |
| /  |  quotient             |  integers, floats            |
| %  |  remainder            |  integers, floats            |
|    |                       |                              |
| &  |  bitwise AND          |  integers                    |
| \| |  bitwise OR           |  integers                    |
| ^  |  bitwise XOR          |  integers                    |
| &^ |  bit clear (AND NOT)  |  integers                    |
|    |                       |                              |
| << |  left shift           |  integer << unsigned integer |
| >> |  right shift          |  integer >> unsigned integer |

### Booleans

Booleans are simple `true` and `false`.

### Strings

Strings are made up of arbitrary bytes that may or may not represent a UTF-8 encoded string. There are two types of strings in Nitrogen,
interpreted strings and raw strings.

Interpreted strings are surrounded by double quotes and cannot contain any new lines (it can't span lines), but it can contain escape sequences:

- \b - Backspace
- \e - Escape
- \f - Form feed
- \n - Newline
- \r - Carriage return
- \t - Horizontal tab
- \v - Vertical tab
- \\\\ - Backspace
- \\" - Double quote

If any other escape sequence is found, the backslash and following character are left untouched. For example the string `"He\llo World"` would
not change in its interpreted form since the escape sequence `\l` isn't valid. It's always good practice to explicitly escape a backslash
rather than relying on this behavior.

Raw strings are slightly different. They're surrounded by single quotes and may span multiple lines. The only valid escape sequence
is `\'`, escaping a single quote. Raw strings can be helpful for templates or large bodies of inline text.

Strings may be indexed like an array using square brackets `"Hello, world"[0] == "H"`. The value of an index expression is another string
with the character at the index of the original string.

## Collections

### Arrays

Arrays work similarly to other languages. They take the form: `[1, "string", true]`. Array elements can be of any type. Arrays can be
indexed using square bracket notation `var[2]`. Nitrogen, like any proper language, uses 0-based array indexing. Please consult the standard
library documentation for functions that can manipulate arrays.

### Hash Maps

Also known as dictionaries or associative arrays are data structures that use key-value pairs. Keys can be strings, ints, or floats. Attempting
to use any other data type will result in an evaluation error. Maps can be created using the syntax `{"key": "value", "key2": "value2"}`.
Map definitions can span multiple lines but be careful of automatic semicolon insertion, every key-value pair must have a comma after it:

```
myMap = {
    "key": "value",
    "key2": "value2", // Note the trailing comma, without it parsing will fail
    "3key": "value3",
}
```

Map values can be retrieved in two ways. The first is standard array index form `myMap["key2"]`. The other using dot notation
`myMap.key2`. Dot notation can be used when the key is a valid identifier. If the key is not a valid identifier,
the normal index notation must be used with a string. The dot notation can also be used for assignment
`myMap.key2 = "another value2"`. The dot notation is left associative meaning any map index will be
resolved before calling a function. Example: `myMap.key2()` is syntactically the same as `(myMap.key2)()`.

## Assignments

Nitrogen supports both variables and constants. All variables must be declared before they can be assigned. A declaration and assignment can
happen at the same time. Here's some examples:

```
// Standard variable
let var = "Hello, Earth"

// Constant
const var2 = "Hello, Mars"

// Variables must be declared before assignment
// The following works because var was defined above
var = "Goodbye, Earth"

// The following fails since it hasn't be declared
anotherVar = "This will fail"

// Obviously, constants can't be changed
var2 = "This also causes an error"
```

Compound operations and assignments are supported using the compound operators +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=. Each operator will perform the given operation
then assign it to the identifier on the left side:

```
let a = 5

a += 2 // a == 7
a -= 3 // a == 4
a *= 2 // a == 8
a /= 4 // a == 2
a %= 4 // a == 1
```

### Constants

Constants can be a string, int, float, or bool. They CANNOT be an array or map.

## Identifiers

Identifiers are the name of a variable, constant, or function. Identifies must start with a valid UTF-8 character from a Letter category
but can be followed by any number of letters, decimal digits, or underscores.

## Functions

Functions allow a programmer to break apart a program into separate chunks that focus on specific tasks. Functions are first class citizens
in Nitrogen. They can be passed around just like any other variable.

```
// Functions can be defined using two syntaxes

let myFunc = func(thing) {
    println(thing)
}

// or

func myFunc(thing) {
    println(thing)
}

// Attempting to combine the two will result in an error

let myFunc = func myFunc(thing) { println(thing) } // This is bad

// Functions are called like so

myFunc("Some variable")
```

## Comparisons/Control Flow

If expressions in Nitrogen are very similar to other languages:

```
if condition {
    ... do stuff
} else {
    ... do other stuff
}
```

The condition may be enclosed in parentheses, but they are completely optional.

Nitrogen supports standard comparison operators:

- `==`: Equal
- `!=`: Not equal
- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
` `<=`: Less than or equal to

An expression can be prefixed with the bang operator to negate it:

```
!true == false
```

Compound comparisons are also possible with the keywords `and` and `or`:

```
if a == b or a == c {
    ... do stuff
}

if a == b and b == c {
    ... then a == c
}
```

Conditions can be groups to change the order or precidence:

```
if a == b or (a == c and a == d) {
    ... do more stuff
}
```

Blocks that would otherwise contain a single statement do not require surrounding braces.
Instead, add a colon after the condition and write the statement.

```
if a == b: return c
```

## Looping

Nitrogen supports a version of the traditional C for loop:

```
// Limited loop
for (i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
    println(i)
}

// Parentheses are optional
for i = 0; i < 10; i += 1 {
    println(i)
}

// Infinite loop
for {
    println("Infinity")
}
```

The initlizer, condition, and incrementor may be enclosed in parentheses, but they are completely optional.

A for loop has three parts in the header. An initializer which is ran before the loop starts, a condition which is evaluated before each
iteration, and an iterator which is ran after the body but before the next condition check.

The initializer must be an assign statement. The keyword `let` is not needed. The condition needs to return a boolean value. See Nitrogen's
boolean logic for what constitutes as true/false. The iterator may be any expression but should increment the loop counter somehow
otherwise it will go in an infinite loop.

Only one variable can be assigned in the initializer.

An inifinate loop can be achieved my simply omitting the entire loop header.

### Loop control

The statements `continue` and `break` can be used to control a loop. `continue` will stop executing the body and begin the next iteration.
`break` will stop the loop completely and continue execution after the loop body.

### Looping over arrays/maps

Loops over arrays can be done by using the length of the array and then getting the value from the array by index.

```
let arr = ["one", "two", "three"]

for (i = 0; i < len(arr); i + 1) {
    println(arr[i])
}

// Outputs:
//  one
//  two
//  three
```

Hash maps can be iterated over by getting the map keys with `hashKeys()` and then iterating over the returned array like above.

```
let map = {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2",
    "key3": "value3",
    "key4": "value4",
}

let keys = hashKeys(map)

for (i = 0; i < len(keys); i + 1) {
    ley key = keys[i]
    println(key, ": ", map[key])
}

// Output:
//  key1: value1
//  key2: value2
//  key3: value3
//  key4: value4
```

### Looping with collections.foreach()

The [collections package](stdlib/imported/collections.ni.md) has a `foreach` method which loops over and array or map without
having to use a loop. The functions takes a functions that receives the index and value of each element.

```
let continents = ["Asia", "Africa", "North America", "South America", "Antarctica", "Europe", "Australia"]

import 'collections.ni'

collections.foreach(continents, func(i, v) {
    println(v) // Prints each continent
})
```

## Try Catch/Exceptions

Nitrogen has a simple concept of exceptions and runtime errors. Exceptions can be created at runtime when a script attempts
to perform an unsafe action. Errors are returned when something goes wrong but isn't necessarily a huge issue.
Some exceptions are labeled as panics. When such an exception is thrown, all execution stops. These are thrown when something
happens internally in the interpreter that causes execution to be in a state in which the programmer can't recover from.

A try/catch block allows catching non-panic exceptions and provides the programmer an opportunity to handle the exception
gracefully. The exception can be bound to an identifier in the catch block so its message can be printed or checked.

Try and catch blocks are in the same scope as surrounding code. Try/catch is an expression in Nitrogen and will
return the last expression just like a function or nil.

Exceptions can be generated by user code using the `throw` keyword follow by an expression.

### Try Catch Examples

A try/catch is also an expression and will return whatever the try block evaluates to if an exception isn't thrown:

```
let m1 = try {
    import "os.so"
} catch e {
    println('Import failed: ', e)
}

println(m1)
```

The value of the try catch is being assigned to m1. If the module imports successfully, m1 will equal the module.
Otherwise it will equal whatever the catch block evaluates to. In this case, because println returns nil m1 will also equal nil.

Try blocks can be nested for fallback functionality:

```
let m1 = try {
    import 'non-existant-module'
} catch e {
    println('Import failed: ', e)
    try {
        import 'os'
    } catch e {
        println('Import2 failed: ', e)
    }
}

println(m1)
```

Here, the first try block will fail, but the second one will succeed so `m1`'s value will be the os module.

A catch block is required, however it can be empty. In that case it evaluates to nil.

```
let m1 = try { import 'non-existant-module' } catch { pass }

println(m1) // Will be nil
```

### User generated exceptions

Using the `throw` keyword, a script can also generate an exception:

```
func myException() {
    throw "Nope"
}

let m1 = try {
    myException()
} catch e {
    println(e) // Will print "Nope"
}

println(m1)
```

Exceptions can also be rethrown:

```
func myException() {
    try {
        myException2()
    } catch e {
        throw e
    }
}

func myException2() {
    throw "Nope"
}

let m1 = try {
    myException()
} catch e {
    println('Outer ', e) // Will print "Outer Nope"
}
```

## Classes

Nitrogen has support for simple classes. Classes are like Python where methods and properties don't have visibility
limitations. It's up to the programmer to use methods as "public" or "private". Classes allow to encapsulate functionality
and data. Instances of a class have different field values while sharing the same method definitions.

### Class Example

```
class name ^ parent {
    let field1
    const field2 = "constant"

    func init(x) { // Initializer function
        this.x = x // The instance can be referenced with "this"
    }

    // Class methods
    func doStuff(msg) {
        return 'ID: ' + toString(this.x) + ' Msg: ' + msg
    }

    func setX(x) {
        this.x = x
    }
}
```

### Class Inheritance

Classes can inherit methods and fields from another class using the inheritance operator `^`.
Classes may have only one parent. Calling the parent init method can be done by calling `parent()`. In methods, the
variable `parent` is bound to the parent class if one is available. If a class doesn't have a parent, `parent` is
not defined. Parent methods can be retrieved like so: `parent.overridenMethod()`. If a method isn't redefined in a child
class, the method can be called directly without consulting the `parent` variable.

```
class parentPrinter {
    let z

    func init() {
        z = "parent thing"
    }

    func doStuff(msg) {
        return 'Parent: ' + z + ' Msg: ' + msg
    }

    func parentOnly() {
        return "I'm the parent"
    }
}

class printer ^ parentPrinter {
    let x
    const t = "Thing"

    func init(x) {
        parent()
        this.x = x
    }

    // Overridden function
    func doStuff(msg) {
        return 'ID: ' + toString(x) + ' Msg: ' + msg
    }

    func doStuff2(msg) {
        return parent.doStuff(msg)
    }
}

let myPrinter = make printer(1)

println(myPrinter.doStuff('Hello')) // Redefined on child class
println(myPrinter.z) // Field from parent class
println(myPrinter.parentOnly()) // Method only on parent class
println(myPrinter.doStuff2('Hello')) // Method that calls the parent's doStuff() method
```

### Creating an Instance

An instance of a class can be created using the `make` keyword followed by the class and any arguments to the init
method.

```
class name ^ parent {
    let field1
    const field2 = "constant"

    func init(x) { // Initializer function
        this.x = x // The instance can be referenced with "this"s
    }

    // Class methods
    func doStuff(msg) {
        return 'ID: ' + toString(x) + ' Msg: ' + msg
    }

    func setX(x) {
        this.x = x
    }
}

let myObject = make name(10)

println(classOf(myObject)) // Prints "name"
```
