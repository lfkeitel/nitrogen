# Literals

Nitrogen literals include integers, floats, booleans, strings, nil, arrays,
hash maps (also known as dictionaries or associative arrays), and functions.

## Nil

Nitrogen's null value is `nil`. `nil` is used to denote the absence of a value. It's
returned from a out of range array or map index among other situations.

## Numbers

Nitrogen makes a distinction between an integer an a floating point number. The two are not
comparable to each other without explicit conversion.

### Integers

Integers are implemented as signed 64-bit numbers giving them a minimum value of
âˆ’9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
Integers can be declared using decimal, octal, or hexadecimal notation.
Here's a few examples:

```
45    // Decimal
0664  // Octal, leading 0
\xA4  // Hexadecimal, prefixed with \x
```

Integers support all the standard arthimatic and bitwise operators and are comparable.

### Floats

Floating point numbers are implemented as 64-bit IEEE floating point numbers.
Floats can only be represented in dotted decimal notation.
Exponential notation is coming soon.
Like ints, floats support the standard arithmatic operations and are comparable.

## Booleans

Booleans are `true` and `false`. Nitrogen has no such thing as "falsy" or "truthy" values.
Only the literals `true` and `false` evaluate as a boolean value.

## Strings

Strings are made up of a collection of UTF-8 code points.
There are two types of strings in Nitrogen, interpreted strings and raw strings.

Interpreted strings are surrounded by double quotes and cannot contain any new lines (it can't span lines), but it can contain escape sequences:

- \b - Backspace
- \e - Escape
- \f - Form feed
- \n - Newline
- \r - Carriage return
- \t - Horizontal tab
- \v - Vertical tab
- \\\\ - Backspace
- \\" - Double quote

If any other escape sequence is found, the backslash and following character are left untouched.
For example the string `"He\llo World"` would not change in its interpreted form since the
escape sequence `\l` isn't valid. It's always good practice to explicitly escape a backslash
rather than relying on this behavior.

Raw strings are slightly different. They're surrounded by single quotes and may span multiple lines.
The only valid escape sequence is `\'`, escaping a single quote. Raw strings can be helpful for
templates or large bodies of inline text.

Strings may be indexed like an array using square brackets `"Hello, world"[0] == "H"`.
The value of an index expression is another string with the character at the index of the
original string.

## Functions

Functions are literals just like anything else but they have their own docs [here](functions.md).
