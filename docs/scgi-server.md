# Nitrogen SCGI Server

Like any other executable code, Nitrogen scripts can be used with CGI to
generate dynamic web content. The Nitrogen interpreter goes one step further and
supports Simple CGI or SCGI. SCGI allows the interpreter to always run and
accepts multiple requests from another web server. Nitrogen does not currently
support running as a stand alone web server. It needs something like Nginx or
Apache in front if it to proxy requests. Using SCGI is more efficient since the
operating system doesn't need to create a new process for every request.
Instead, all requests are handled in a single process.

Nitrogen supports concurrent requests meaning it can fulfill multiple proxy
requests at the same time. The number of workers is configurable. By default, 5
workers are created to handle requests.

## Flags

These are the flag given to Nitrogen to configure SCGI.

- `-scgi`: Enable the SCGI server. With this flag, no script is executed and the
  interactive prompt is not shown. Without this, none of the remaining flags
  have any effect.
- `-scgi-sock`: TCP or Unix socket to listen on. Ex: `tcp:127.0.0.1:9000` or
  `unix:/var/run/nitrogen-scgi.sock`. This defaults to `tcp:0.0.0.0:9000`.
- `-scgi-workers`: The number of workers available to handle requests. Defaults
  to 5.
- `-scgi-worker-timeout`: The number of seconds the server will wait for an
  available worker. If all workers are busy, the server will wait this long
  before closing the connection. If this timeout is reached, an error message
  will be printed to standard output saying there weren't enough workers to
  handle incoming requests. You can use this to adjust the number of workers
  available. Defaults to 10.

## Scripts

The only change to normal script execution is any print statements will go to
the client's browser, not the process's normal standard output. The `_ENV`
variable will contain any CGI variables provided by the upstream web server.
